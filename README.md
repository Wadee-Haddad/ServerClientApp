This repository contains a simple client-server communication program using sockets. The server asks the client for their name and age, then performs basic math operations based on the expressions provided by the client.

## Features

- Server greets the client and asks for their name.
- Client provides their name to the server.
- Server asks the client for their age.
- Client provides their age to the server.
- Server and client engage in a conversation where the client can enter math expressions, and the server performs the corresponding operations.
- The conversation continues until the client types 'exit' to quit.
